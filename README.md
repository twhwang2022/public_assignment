Hi Jorge
To run this,

1. open stata
2. type "sysdir" to see where your personal ado folder is
3. copy the two files in the ado folder to your personal ado folder
4. run lst-sa-table_2.do -> this gives you the first main table
5. run lst-sa-table_3.do -> this give you the second main table

6. make sure your working directory can be called by the name "projects"
